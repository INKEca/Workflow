(The other heroine, known as <TCHARACTERNAME>Maud Lilly</TCHARACTERNAME>, is not generally fond of books, as a result of being trained and slave-driven by her uncle as a helper in his work towards a <TTHEMETOPIC>definitive bibliography of pornographic texts</TTHEMETOPIC>. But Maud mentions one book which she has read with attention&mdash;<TITLE TITLETYPE="MONOGRAPHIC" REG="Les Liaisons Dangereuses">Les Liaisons dangereuses</TITLE> by <NAME>Pierre Choderlos de Laclos</NAME>.)</TINTERTEXTUALITY> Nothing in this novel is as it seems. Susan believes that her mother was <TTHEMETOPIC>hanged for <TMOTIF>murder</TMOTIF></TTHEMETOPIC>. The <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>mother-substitute in her life, whom she dearly loves, is <TCHARACTERNAME>Mrs Sucksby</TCHARACTERNAME>, who lives by <TTHEMETOPIC>farming infants</TTHEMETOPIC></TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>. She is kind to the babies in her care, but does not expect them to survive. As well as many of her charges she has <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="death of child">lost a baby of her own</TMOTIF>, and Susan believes she has taken the lost daughter&apos;s place. They live with <TCHARACTERNAME>Mr Ibbs</TCHARACTERNAME>, a highly skilled <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>fence for stolen goods</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>; other characters come and go. Susan grows up literally in a thieves&apos; kitchen; where the daily chores include quieting infants with gin, driviing hard bargains with petty criminals, obliterating crests from stolen silverware and picking the initials out of stolen silk handkerchiefs. She grows up cherished and loving, the pet of the household.</P><P>She becomes linked to Maud through a scheme by a man they know as <SOCALLED><TCHARACTERNAME REG="Gentleman">Gentleman</TCHARACTERNAME></SOCALLED>, because he claims upper-class origins and to have run through a fortune before he turned to living by his wits. Gentleman has met Maud&apos;s <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>elderly, reclusive pornographer uncle</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> and apparently schemes to steal his niece, <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="mercenary marriage">marry her for her money</TMOTIF>, and dispose of her in a lunatic asylum. He says his plan needs an <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>accomplice, a lady&apos;s maid</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> to live with Maud, persuade her, control her, and effect the <TMOTIF>elopement</TMOTIF>. For this role he chooses Susan.</P><P>SW excels at establishing the reality of an exotic scene or microcosm: <TSETTINGPLACE SETTINGPLACETYPE="FICTIVE" SETTINGCLASS="WIDERANGE">first the hot kitchen in Lant Street, in a blind court up a noxious alley in <PLACE><SETTLEMENT CURRENT="London" REG="Southwark">Southwark</SETTLEMENT> (<SOCALLED>the Borough</SOCALLED>)<REGION REG="Surrey"></REGION><GEOG REG="England"></GEOG></PLACE>, then the remote and dilapidated country house in the Thames Valley, Briar near <PLACE><SETTLEMENT>Marlow</SETTLEMENT><REGION REG="Buckinghamshire"></REGION><GEOG REG="England"></GEOG></PLACE>, full of draughts and damp and cold and silence, where Susan sets herself to play the role of <TCHARACTERNAME REG="Trinder, Susan">Susan Smith</TCHARACTERNAME>, experienced lady&apos;s maid, to a mistress who seems naive, ignorant, childish, and increasingly pitiable. Outside is the park, the church, and the grave of Maud&apos;s mother, who (Maud believes) died in <TMOTIF>childbirth</TMOTIF>, <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="madness">raving in a lunatic asylum</TMOTIF>.</TSETTINGPLACE> Maud&apos;s earliest memories are of growing up in the madhouse, the cherished pet of the nurses, before her uncle took her on as his <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE PROTAGONIST="FEMALE">helper or domestic slave</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>. Susan knows nothing about the <TTHEMETOPIC>pornography</TTHEMETOPIC>, only that Maud spends her mornings reading to her uncle, and takes dinner with him in the evening (while Susan eats hers with other servants). For the rest of the day the two women (or girls, for both are still in their teens) are alone. At night they share a bed, at Maud&apos;s insistence because she is subject to <TTHEMETOPIC>night terrors</TTHEMETOPIC>.</P><P>The relationship that grows between them is understated. Susan feels for her mistress as well as despising her, but holds back from too much feeling, remembering she is there as a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE PROTAGONIST="FEMALE">betrayer</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>. Maud is opaque to the reader as well as to Susan until after the <TMOTIF>elopement</TMOTIF> scheme has been carried out, and before that the girls have made love, suddenly and with increasing passion. This event does not fit the plan, and does not apparently affect it. Susan remembers, but neither mentions it.</P><P><TVOICENARRATION>Until the elopement, Susan appears within her limits like an omniscient narrator.</TVOICENARRATION> After she has fled with Maud into the hands of Gentleman (or <SOCALLED>Mr Richard</SOCALLED>) she finds that the <TTHEMETOPIC>plot</TTHEMETOPIC> she was aware of was itself a trick. <TPLOT><TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="role reversal">Roles are forcibly reversed</TMOTIF>; it is not Maud but Susan who is abandoned in the madhouse as Gentleman&apos;s discarded tool. Maud he takes to London, not to a fine house as she had expected but to Lant Street, which the reader now sees through her horrified eyes. The central section of the story is occupied by the efforts of each woman to escape her captivity, while the madhouse joins Lant Street and Briar as a third setting where abnormality is normal. When the plot is at last resolved, through the <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="violence">violent death</TMOTIF> of Gentleman, it comes out that not only roles but identities have been swapped; that the undoing of both girls was a condition of the plotters making their fortunes. Villains get their come-uppance; Maud retreats to Briar to exercise her only marketable skill by writing pornography, while Susan sets out to find her.</TPLOT> Having mercilessly debunked sentiment throughout her story, SW may seem to some to succumb to sentiment in the way the women&apos;s <TTHEMETOPIC>erotic bond</TTHEMETOPIC> endures as a lifeline, but even her sex passages are never less than convincing and the <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="happy ending">happy ending is somewhat tenuous</TMOTIF>.</P></SHORTPROSE></TEXTUALFEATURES><RECEPTION><SHORTPROSE><P><RRECOGNITIONS>This book was <RRECOGNITIONNAME>shortlisted for both the Orange Prize and the Man Booker Prize</RRECOGNITIONNAME> and won the <RRECOGNITIONNAME>Crime Writers&apos; Association Ellis Peters Historical Dagger</RRECOGNITIONNAME>.
