The island in the original novel was Mauritius.</TSETTINGPLACE> <TPLOT>In the play Marie, a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>French peasant</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>, came to the island to get away from the man who tricked her into a fake marriage. She has a son named <TCHARACTERNAME>Florian</TCHARACTERNAME>. <TCHARACTERNAME>Madame de Fleury</TCHARACTERNAME>, a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>widow</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>, was disowned by her family for <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="cross-class love">marrying beneath her station</TMOTIF> and is currently struggling with poverty following her husband&apos;s death. She has a daughter, <TCHARACTERNAME>Lelia</TCHARACTERNAME>. The woman are close friends who are thrilled when their children begin to show an interest in each other. The idyllic island life, and a perfect love transcending class difference, are from the original. But Madame de Fleury&apos;s sister, <TCHARACTERNAME>Madame de Merac</TCHARACTERNAME>, wishes Lelia to come and stay with her in <TSETTINGPLACE SETTINGPLACETYPE="REAL"><PLACE><SETTLEMENT>Paris</SETTLEMENT><GEOG REG="France"></GEOG></PLACE></TSETTINGPLACE> and she offers desperately needed money as an incentive for the visit. Madame de Fleury allows Lelia to go. Lelia is followed by the <TCHARACTERNAME>Baron de Valmy</TCHARACTERNAME>, who wishes to secure her as his bride. When Madame de Merac tells Lelia she has <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="arranged marriage">arranged for her to marry</TMOTIF> her son, the <TCHARACTERNAME>Count de Merac</TCHARACTERNAME>, Baron de Valmy sees this as an opportunity to gain Lelia&apos;s trust. He offers to <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="rescue">help her escape</TMOTIF> and to take her back to the island. Desperate not to be married, Lelia agrees. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to her, Florian has discovered that the marriage of his mother Marie was legitimate; he is legally the son of the man she left&mdash;who is Madame de Merac&apos;s <SOCALLED>husband</SOCALLED>. He goes to France to prove his legitimacy and ask for Lelia&apos;s hand in marriage. Baron de Valmy works to keep the two lovers separated by telling each of them lies. Eventually, however, Florian finds Lelia and saves her from the baron. The two of them are <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="happy ending">happily reunited </TMOTIF>at the end of the play,<BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="The Era 2249 (29 October 1881)" DBREF="68987">2249 (29 October 1881)</BIBCIT></BIBCITS> with no hint of <NAME STANDARD="Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Jacques Henri">Saint-Pierre</NAME>&apos;s tragic ending (in which the heroine is drowned).</TPLOT></P></SHORTPROSE></TEXTUALFEATURES><RECEPTION><SHORTPROSE><P><RRESPONSES RESPONSETYPE="INITIAL" FORMALITY="FORMAL">The reviews reflect another success for INH.
