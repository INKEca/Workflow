At the climax of the novel Alex natches the willing Kitty away from New York to his grotty London flat. He also takes advantage of a false rumour of her death to sell some of her signatures for a price that will keep her in comfort for the rest of her life. His saleroom coup seems likely, however, to overwhelm his autograph career with the jealousy of his peers.
