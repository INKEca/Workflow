Brennan&apos;s other relationship of the time was broken in 1962, but Larkin remained simultaneously committed to his other relationship, with Monica Jones. Brennan&apos;s parents expected her and Larkin to marry and she must surely have expected the same at first. She parted with him for the period between July 1973 and November 1974 (the longest of several separations), then renewed the relationship with new intensity. Brennan makes two statements about the final break: that it came after a violent quarrel (only their second) in March 1978, and that it came more than a year later, after she had embarked on a new relationship.<BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Brennan 26-30, 39, 43, 46-7, 50-1, 63, 67-8, 88-9, 140" DBREF="65806">26-30, 39, 43, 46-7, 50-1, 63, 67-8, 88-9, 140</BIBCIT></BIBCITS><SCHOLARNOTE><P>Larkin&apos;s successor in her affections was <NAME>David Bassett</NAME>, a historian, whom she called <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">the most magnanimous man I have ever met.</QUOTE><BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Brennan 115" DBREF="65806">115</BIBCIT></BIBCITS></P></SCHOLARNOTE> In September 1967 Brennan wrote to Larkin in real anger about the <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">web of deceit</QUOTE> involved. <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">I really fail to understand why you can&apos;t be a little more open about me with M.
