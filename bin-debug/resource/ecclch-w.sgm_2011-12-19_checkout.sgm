I thought that it might be easier to have you take a look sometime earlier next week, rather than send two completed documents at once. Also,I have having some problems with Eccles&apos; article &quot;The Experienec of a Woman Journalist,&quot; and &quot;Irish Housekeeping&quot;. Both articles have different pages than that used in the Orlando documents. The on Experienec is not too large a problem, because I can still verify the content. The &quot;Irish&quot; article is more challenging, because it is quite a large document, and there&apos;s no &apos;search&apos; tool.
