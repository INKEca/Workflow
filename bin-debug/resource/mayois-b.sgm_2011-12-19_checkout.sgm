Educ. at a private school, she pub. stories and verse in her &apos;teens, and her first serial, {FCabbrevTitle}The Secret Drawer{/FCabbrevTitle}, in 1867. In a &apos;life and death fight&apos; to pay inherited debts, she toiled as secretary and &apos;law writer&apos; 1860-9, including a stint at Bessie PARKES&apos; Office for the Employment of Women. Her first, best-known novel, {FCabbrevTitle}Occupations of a Retired Life{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1867, is an evangelical story of an elderly sister and brother, Ruth and Edward Garrett, whence her pseudonym. In 1870 she m. John Ryall M., solicitor. Among her many novels are {FCabbrevTitle}By Still Waters{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1874, {FCabbrevTitle}The Capel Girls{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1876, {FCabbrevTitle}Family Fortunes{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1881, and {FCabbrevTitle}Her Object in Life{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1881? This last, about a woman&apos;s struggles with her selfish brother, implicitly challenges the ideal of female self-sacrifice. She also ed. a collection of Aesop&apos;s fables, 1877, and two collections of sayings and stories from Great Britain and the near East, 1910 and 1911. She taught Russian and TRANSLATED several works by Tolstoy, wrote reviews, articles on history and travel, and biographical essays for a variety of magazines.
