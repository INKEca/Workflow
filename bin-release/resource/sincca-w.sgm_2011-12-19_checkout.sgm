Edinburgh, fourth da. of Diana (Macdonald), who was second wife of Sir John S. CS never married, but acted as secretary to her father from the age of 14 until he died (1835), whereupon she began her own writing, in between her numerous charitable works. Initially she wrote for her nephew, the most popular book being {FCabbrevTitle}Holiday House: a series of tales{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1839, really a conversion-narrative. She wrote books on Shetland, 1840, Scotland, 1840, as well as many more tales for young people and didactic novels like the fiercely anti-Catholic {FCabbrevTitle}Beatrice; or, the Unknown Relatives{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1852. Other novels, such as {FCabbrevTitle}Modern Flirtations; or, a Month at Harrowgate{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1841, and {FCabbrevTitle}Cross Purposes{/FCabbrevTitle}, 1855, are interestingly prefaced by CS&apos;s views on the current moral status of fiction-reading (and writing). Despite their &apos;improving&apos; aim and predictable plotting, her works reveal a lively, intelligent writer of acerbic wit and unusual insight into human motivation. </BIOGPROSE></DIV0></WRITING>
