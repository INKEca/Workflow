But then, in a turmoil of tears and contradictory emotions, she begs Hortense and Gilbert to take the baby and bring him up as their own. Ironically, Bernard sees no problem over keeping the baby (he plans just to say that he is adopted) even while his jealous prejudice against Gilbert shows no sign of abating.

(He has challenged his mother&apos;s story and compelled her to revise it before, when she seemed set to pass by his own birth without ever mentioning it.) Now he makes her embark on the true ending: <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="financial ruin">how she was starving, and in court for stealing a chicken</TMOTIF>, when he saw her again after forty years. Thus compelled, she resumes her tale by confiding: <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">it was, in-matter-of-fact, two stolen fowls.

She is the <SOCALLED>pickney</SOCALLED> of a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE><SOCALLED>field nigger</SOCALLED> (her heroic mother)</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> until she catches the eye of a white woman fresh from England, <TCHARACTERNAME>Caroline Mortimer</TCHARACTERNAME>, and is taken (willingly, excitedly) to be a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>house slave</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> and to be called Marguerite, to experience <TTHEMETOPIC>boredom, and homesickness, and beatings</TTHEMETOPIC>, but, as she grows up, increasingly to enjoy the superiority of her situation. This situation is interrupted by terror, violence, and rebellion. (July&apos;s son says this was the <TTHEMETOPIC>Baptist War&mdash;also known as the Great Slave Revolt</TTHEMETOPIC>&mdash;whereas July says that in those old times when news travelled only by the garbled tales of little running boys, such historical events were not perceived by those who lived through them.) At this time <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="violence">the slave village is destroyed by <TTHEMETOPIC>raging white men</TTHEMETOPIC> with inconceivable brutality</TMOTIF>. July&apos;s mother kills her white overseer father, as the only way to save July&apos;s life, and is hanged for it. <SOCALLED>Massa</SOCALLED> <TCHARACTERNAME>John Howarth</TCHARACTERNAME>, brother of July&apos;s mistress, witnesses such revolting violence (not between white and black but directed by outraged whites against <NAME>Thomas Burchell</NAME>, the white Baptist missionary who has preached equality before God) that he comes home and <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="suicide">shoots himself</TMOTIF>&mdash;on a chair beside the bed where July, drunk, has just surrendered her virginity to a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>forceful, pushy, but not attractive free black man</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>. Horror is counterpointed with farce as the hungover lovers hide crushed under the bed while whites confer and panic, until July&apos;s lover is <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="murder">shot and killed</TMOTIF>, and once dead is falsely named as the murderer of Massa Howarth.</P><P>The <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>endlessly incompetent and self-deluding white lady</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>, Caroline, is left to run the plantation, which she manages by dint of teaching July to read, write, and master arithmetic. July even stays with her mistress when <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="abolition of slavery">emancipation</TMOTIF> comes at last, when on <DATE>31 July 1838</DATE> a coffin is lowered into the ground at <PLACE><SETTLEMENT>Falmouth</SETTLEMENT><GEOG REG="Jamaica"></GEOG><AREA REG="Caribbean"></AREA></PLACE> inscribed with a death notice for <QUOTE DIRECT="Y"><TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="slavery">Colonial slavery</TMOTIF> . . . aged 276 years.</QUOTE><BIBCITS><BIBCIT PLACEHOLDER="Levy, Long Song 139" DBREF="65749">139</BIBCIT></BIBCITS> Later yet another new <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>white overseer arrives, the young and handsome</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> <TCHARACTERNAME>Robert Goodwin</TCHARACTERNAME>, who believes that the ex-slaves must be done good to, must be refashioned as loyal, happy, industrious, and willing to work twice as hard now they are free as when they were chattel. Robert is a <TCHARACTERTYPEROLE>pious man, son of a parson</TCHARACTERTYPEROLE> in England. He fights his attraction for July until he conceives the mad yet practicable scheme of <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="adultery">marrying Caroline and making July his secret mistress</TMOTIF>. This plan is in place when trouble breaks out again. Robert Goodwin invites, then commands, the negroes to work in the cane pieces over the Christmas season, and they all refuse. Thwarted, Goodwin calls in the same white thugs once used by Howarth, and the former slave village is once again as comprehensively and as violently destroyed as before. This time the persecuted free blacks leave en masse, to become <TTHEMETOPIC>squatters on poor land where they will be harrassed and abused</TTHEMETOPIC> until most will die. Goodwin takes his wife Caroline, and his and July&apos;s child, and leaves for England. July enters the <TMOTIF MOTIFNAME="financial ruin">downward spiral of impoverishment and despair</TMOTIF> that she refuses to tell until her blacker son compels her.</P><P>This book is far from shirking the horrors of slavery. In the dungeon used to enforce discipline on the plantation named Amity, slaves are writhing in chains. <QUOTE DIRECT="Y">A man (Richard Young from the first gang) was pinned to the wall by his upheld arms.

Slave musicians perform execrably for white guests who comment on their inability to relate to music; but they play sweetly afterwards, outdoors, for their own amusement. July regularly ignores her mistress&apos;s calling her until she is ready, then arrives in a flurry as if she has been racing to obey.
